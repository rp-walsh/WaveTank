This dirctory contains the code to solve the toy gravity wave problem:

\vec{u}_t = -grad(P)-g\rho\hat{z}

div(\vec{u}) = 0

s_t + w = 0

\rho = -s.

This code is meant to be a skeleton for the time-stepping of the full cloud modeling problem.

This code uses a split-step temporal discretization:

Lapl(P)^{n+1/2} = -g\rho_z^{n+1/2}; P_\hat{n} = 0 @ top,bottom; Per. in x

\vec{u}^{n+1} = u^n - dt*(grad(P)^{n+1/2} + g*\rho^{n+1/2}\hat{z})

s^{n+3/2} = s^{n+1/2} - dt*w^{n+1}

\rho^{n+3/2} = F(x,z,s^{n+3/2})
