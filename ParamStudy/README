ParamStudy was created to examine the quantity (gK_0(c+-)/omega^2 - 1) that determines the solution structure.
i.e. in order to have wave like solutions in z this quantity needs to be positive.

From the results of this directory we saw that for 'reasonable' values of c+ and c- the above quantity is
positive. There we're some strange observations in computing the above quantity for particular values of
c+ and c- namely for small values we had difficulty even computing the dispersion relation as well as
jumps in the values of the above quantity for certain choices of c+ and c-. I believe these can be attributed
to the root finder for the dispersion relation however I have not confirmed this. I have decided that moving on
to the full problem and re-examining the behaviour there is more valuable.
